		<h1>Estate planning</h1>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>A last will and testament is the cornerstone of every estate plan but not adequate for estate planning, it is only part of it.  Estate planning does not have to be complicated, but it is important to make sure that you have done the complete estate planning before you write your will. Estate planning is not only done by wealthy people who want to evade taxes, but is done for the determination, management, security and coordination of a person\'s assets in such a way that he / she will ensure the maximum benefit for their loved ones after death.</p>
			<p>When doing your estate planning, it is essential to focus on the liquidity of the estate as well as the estate tax. Liquidity refers to the cash available to pay the administration costs and liabilities in the estate and the estate taxes refer on how to keep taxes to a minimum. If there is not enough cash in the estate to cover the costs, the administration process can be delayed and the heirs may be harmed.</p>
			<p>Many people do not feel comfortable having a constructive conversation with their heirs, but it can have incredibly positive consequences. Especially in the case where you explain your affairs to your heirs and propose to keep certain properties because it holds good benefits, while rather selling others on account of your expertise that they may not have. Sometimes it is also necessary to discuss estate matters with your loved ones to ensure that you as the testator make the right decisions.</p>
			<p>People sometimes make the mistake to think that they can wait until retirement before doing proper estate analysis. It is often too late and you no longer qualify for the necessary life insurance, which offers a solution to supplement deficits. Life insurance is much more expensive if taken out at an advanced age.  Sometimes people also tend to make the valuation of their business and properties too high, not keeping in mind that it will be difficult to quickly sell a business or property within an estate. Especially in the case of a business, there might be an extremely limited market.</p>
			<p>An estate planning specialist can help you save estate taxes in a valid and legal way. We’ve all heard of people advising each other (meaning well) but unknowingly it can lead to illegal tax evasion. Legislation is well in place, so do not think for one minute that you will be able to get away with it. At some point, it is going to catch up with you. The bequest of your assets must be in accordance with your estate planning. Through thorough estate planning you also make sure that you make provision for unforeseen expenses, i.e.
				<ul>
					<li>Funeral expenses</li>
					<li>Executor fees</li>
					<li>Administrator fees</li>
					<li>Outstanding income tax</li>
					<li>Estate tax (there are three types of taxes payable by your estate namely estate tax, income tax and capital gains tax)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>After death, the funds in your bank accounts are not accessible and assets are frozen until an executor is appointed. A life policy is highly recommended because it provides immediate cash flow to your dependents, as an estate can take months to complete. A life policy will immediately be paid to the beneficiaries and cannot be claimed by creditors, should your estate be declared insolvent. However, this does not apply if you are married in community of property or if you have signed surety for your spouse\'s debt.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Appoint an executor</h2>
			<p>The Master of the Supreme Court oversees the estate. The Executor applies to the Master of the Supreme Court by submitting a "Letter of Appointment as Executor of the Estate". The Executor will be responsible for paying all debts, collecting fees and ensuring that the remaining assets are divided fairly according to the provisions of the will. It is important to appoint an expert in the field of estate law.  Make sure the person you choose is honest, reliable, trustworthy, easily accessible to beneficiaries and, in the case of cash assets, possess the necessary investment prowess.</p>
			<p>Generally, the surviving spouse or a loved one is appointed in the will as the executor of an estate. It may happen that this person does not have the necessary knowledge to administer an estate. In such a case, it would be wise for the person to appoint a specialist in the area to administer the estate on his / her behalf. The person may also request several quotes and pre- negotiate the fee to make sure excessive administration costs are not charged.  If you have enough confidence in an institution / person, you may appoint this institution/person in your testament as the executor of your estate. Negotiate the executer fees beforehand and state the agreed rate in the will. Hereby you will not leave it to your loved ones after your passing to make the decision of whom to appoint and negotiate executor fees.</p>
			<p>Keep in mind that fees which an executor is entitled to is currently 3.5% of the gross estate value plus 14% VAT (if the executor is registered for VAT) in total. Executor compensation also does not include any other administration costs e.g. transfer costs of the immovable assets or funeral costs. Keep these costs in mind when doing your estate planning, especially where property is involved.</p>
			<p>An executor has a duty to complete the administration of the estate within a reasonable time. A competent executor should take between three to fifteen months to administer an estate. The law stipulates that the liquidation and distribution accounts must be submitted to the Master of the Supreme Court within six months from the date of issue of the executor\'s letter. The executor may ask for an extension if he / she has good reasons for doing so. If the finishing of the estate lingers unnecessarily, the beneficiaries as well as the creditors\' may lay an objection to the Master of the High Court requesting that the executor must be removed and hand in a nomination for the appointment of a new executor.</p>
			<p>An appointed executor in a will may refuse to act as executor. In such a case, the executor must submit a waiver. The beneficiaries must (at the same time) nominate a new executor with the Master of the High Court. This process can lead to a delay in the administration of the estate.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Administrators</h2>
			<p>An administrator could be appointed if you prefer that a person other than the executor, handle the financial planning of your estate assets. However, you must consider that an additional administrator fee will be charged.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Guardians</h2>
			<p>Appoint a guardian to care for your minor or dependent children.  It is important that you choose a responsible person(s) that you can trust with the general as well as financial care of your minor children. Discuss your decision with potential guardians to make sure they are prepared to take on the responsibilities of raising your children.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Testamentary trust (if you have minor children)</h2>
			<p>The purpose of a testamentary trust is that the appointee protects your minor heirs’ estate assets until they are of age (normally 25 years old) to take control over their finances. This trust is only established after your death and can have large income as well as estate tax benefits. The trust contains provisions such as; 
				<ul>
					<li>how capital assets should be divided</li>
					<li>the time-period</li>
					<li>the powers of trustees</li>
					<li>how the trust should be exercised e.g. survivors, studies etc. as well as remuneration of trustees - normally 6% of the annual income of the trust.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>In the case of a large estate and a high income is generated from the trust, it is better to establish a trust for each child. This trust also prevents a former spouse (if you are divorced) from accessing your children\'s inheritance.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Insolvency Trust</h2>
			<p>A clause that should be written by default in every will is to stipulate that if one of your heirs is declared insolvent before you die, the inheritance will be transferred to an Insolvency trust. In such a case, the assets are then received by the trustees and kept until the heir is rehabilitated. This is a legal way to ensure that the inheritance does not end up in the hands of creditors.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Foreign assets</h2>
			<p>Foreign assets are calculated as part of your estate. Make sure that the country where your assets are held has a double taxation agreement with South Africa. Consider a separate will in that country as it will help with the administration of the estate.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Limited rights</h2>
			<p>You can also decide on limited rights such as: - 
				<ul>
					<li>Usufruct (life interest) that the property (e.g. From a farm / business / property) is transferred to the heirs, but the revenue goes to the surviving spouse. If possible, stay away from usufruct.</li>
					<li>Fiduciary rights (inheritance) stipulate that everything is bequeathed to the surviving spouse and is only bequeathed to the children upon the death of the surviving spouse. The assets then again form part of the surviving spouse\'s estate and are therefore no longer highly recommended.</li>
					<li>Annuities stipulate that the children inherit the property (e.g. farm, business) and the survivor receives an annual amount (with an escalation clause) for life from the children. Be careful that large annuities do not place too much burden on the children and that your children may have to bear this burden for many years.</li>         
					<li>Liability determination can stipulate that a sibling gets first option to buy the property (e.g. farm, property, business). The amount is not fixed but is determined at current market value.</li>
					<li>Buy-and-sell agreement is important if you own a business as the business must continue while the estate is still in the process.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>General</h2>
			<p>Think very carefully before making any specific provisions or restricted rights in your will. Keep in mind that even if your intention is very good at that point and you are convince that you are making the right decisions, a provision can remain valid for years (if not decades), that laws and circumstances change constantly and due to that become a great burden for your loved ones instead of a wonderful gift.</p>
			<p>If there is a cash shortage in the estate, the heirs can pay in or assets may be sold.</p>
			<p>An estate can be reopened if properties are discovered after the settlement of the estate by simply re-submitting an application to the Master of the Supreme Court and appointing an executor.</p>

			<h2>Letters from heirs</h2>
			<p>Please read below letters of individuals sharing their experiences of the consequences of limited rights being included in a testament.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Dear Reader</p>
					<p>As heirs we learned a big lesson regarding the content of a will and how important the wording of the will is.  Consult widely before drawing up your will and talk to people with experience of limited rights should you consider it your preferred choice.</p>
					<p>With my father\'s will we obtained the advice of an attorney, since his will contained blood- and step relationships.  He wanted to ensure his spouse (from his second marriage) was financially secured till her death or re-marriage, but at the same time that his heirs are not disadvantaged or swindled out of their inheritance.  Usufruct of all financial assets was suggested and sounded like the desired solution.  Wording in his will read that all movable assets had to be sold and the profits be invested by his heirs according to their discretion and the profits to be paid over to his spouse.  Should the immovable assets be sold, the same procedures were to be followed.</p>
					<p>After his passing and on request of the spouse, the heirs agreed to purchase a unit in a retirement village which the spouse would use as residence. This setup worked well until, after two years, the spouse decided she does not want to live there any longer.  This created a vastly challenging situation.</p>
					<p>As heirs and owners of the unit we had to consider all possibilities – the location of the retirement village was problematic, it was costly to sell the unit and buy another, the real estate market was not favorable from a seller\'s point of few and renting the unit created all sorts of challenges.</p>
					<p>With all of this in mind investing in real estate is still an option to consider. If all the funds are just invested, there is no capital growth and the heirs can end up with an inheritance far less worth than the initial investment.  Investing in real estate, should increase in value in time and if the property is to be sold after the death of re-marriage of the spouse, the heirs could end up with an asset worth a lot more that the original purchase price.</p>
					<p>It is advisable to consider very carefully whether usufruct will be your answer.</p>
					<p>THE HEIRS</p>
					<p>****************</p>
					<p>Dear reader</p>
					<p>With the death of our mother, disputes arose between the heirs due to different interpretation of certain provision in her will. By following a mediation (conciliation) procedure, we could have resolved these disputes between the heirs in a much cheaper, easier and faster way.</p>
					<p>The big difference between mediation and a court decision or arbitration is that in the case of mediation there does not have to be a winner and a loser to reach a solution, but rather a significantly greater chance of reaching a settlement. It is a voluntary process without prejudice to rights. The decisions and agreements come from the heirs being involved themselves. They take ownership and responsibility of the process and the mediator is there to facilitate the process and, where necessary, provide legal knowledge.</p>
					<p>More and more people are choosing to follow this path rather than settle a case in court or by arbitration. Due to our own experience we can attest to this and strongly recommend following this route.</p>
					<p>WAYNE AND LORIKA</p>
					<p>****************</p>
					<p>Dear Reader</p>
					<p>With the administration of my mother\'s estate, we realized how important the wording of a will is. I would like to share a few points with you that caused a two-year delay in the settling of her estate.<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Clearly explain how assets should be divided between living children and children who have died, e.g. Children (in life) equal distribution and children (deceased) equal distribution to their descendants.</li>
							<li>Draw up a codicil if an heir borrows money and clearly state the amount, the purpose of the loan as well as the repayment agreement e.g. that the borrowed amount of the heir’s portion of the estate must be deducted. If the amount exceeds the heir’s inheritance portion, how and when it must be paid over to the estate.</li>
							<li>Good communication between the person reporting the estate and the executor is important. In our case, a bank was appointed as executor and we found that their response-time to emails and request for information was terribly slow. Afrikaans as a language was also a major obstacle.</li>
							<li>Original car registration documents as well as the police clearance document for proof that her firearm was stolen during a burglary could not be traced and a re-issuance had to be requested.</li>
						</ul>
