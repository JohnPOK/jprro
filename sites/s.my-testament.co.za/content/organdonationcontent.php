		<h1>Organ donation</h1>
		<p>Because we do not have a tradition of organ donation, the need for additional tissue in South Africa is extremely high. By being an organ donor, you can save the lives of 7 people and help a further 50 people. There are 4000-5000 people on a waiting list for organ donations in South Africa.</p>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Who can be a donor?</h2>
			<p>Any person who is in good health and does not suffer from a chronic illness that can negatively affect the recipient, can be an organ donor. South Africa\'s medical rules and legislation on organ donation is extremely strict and determine that a transplant team may not be involved in any way with the declaration of death.</p>
			<p>No organ, tissue, skin or even bone marrow and blood may be sold or bought. The law makes it clear that neither you nor your family may be compensated for it and that the recipient may not pay for it. The process involved in removing, transporting, preserving and transplanting organs is very expensive and therefore the recipient or their medical aid must pay for it. Thereby there is no profit motive.</p>

			<h2>How do I become an organ donor?</h2>
			<p>Becoming an organ donor is a quite simple process. The registration process is easy and is done online on the organ donation website.</p>
			<p>You do not need to undergo medical tests as the doctors will check your medical records, do blood tests as well as a physical examination to determine if your organs are fit to be donated.</p>
			<p>It is your free choice to change your decision at any time. The Organ Donor Association considers it essential that you thoroughly discuss this decision with your loved ones about which organs and tissues you would like to donate. After death, organs may not be removed until your loved ones give their consent. For privacy and legal reasons, donors and recipients are not identified.</p>
			<p>The funeral of an organ donor is not postponed or delayed due to the donation. Once the donated organs and tissues are removed, the body is returned to the family. The necessary respect and dignity are also shown when organs and tissues are removed so that a body is not violated in the process.</p>

			<h2>Body donation for medical research</h2>
			<p>You may decide to donate your body for medical research. However, you must register for this.  Note that this is completely different to being an organ- or tissue donor.</p>
			<p>Body donation to universities are used for the following reasons: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>For research relating to organ transplants</li>
					<li>Teaching medical students and specialists about human anatomy</li>
					<li>Research on tissue donation and transplants</li>
				</ul>
			<p>To donate a body, a selection process must be undergone. No age restriction has been set, but it can be rejected if:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>death occurred outside 200km radius</li>
					<li>a post-mortem was done</li>
					<li>if it was an unnatural or an accidental death</li>
					<li>if the donor died of disseminated cancer</li>
				</ul>
			<p>The medical research lasts from two to four years but can last up to eight years with permission. After the university has finished their research, the body is returned to the family so that the final funeral or cremation can take place.</p>
