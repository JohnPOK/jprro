		<h1>Last will and testaments</h1>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Prevalence</h2>
			<p>According to the Master of the Supreme Court, almost 80% of South Africans do not have a valid will. This is extremely worrying, as a will is of the utmost importance to make sure that your assets which you have worked hard for and built up for years (maybe decades) are passed on to your loved ones according to your wishes.</p>
			<p>It is of the utmost importance to obtain as much information as possible <b>before</b> compiling your will. The need for a well-planned, easy-to-understand, legal and practicable will cannot be overemphasized. A practically executable will is the beginning of a successful administration of an estate.</p>
			<p>People also very easily make the mistake of trying to rule from the grave, thereby putting unnecessary pressure on their heirs. Make sure your will is drafted in a way that makes sense and is easy to execute. An important point is (if possible) not to leave any decisions to the heirs, as this is a winning recipe for a family dispute.</p>

			<h2>Who can and should have a will?</h2>
			<p>Section 4 of the Will Act provides that any person over the age of 16 may draw up a will unless the person is mentally incapable of understanding the nature and extent of his conduct.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>What happens if you die without a last will and testament?</h2>
			<p>If no will of a deceased can be traced, that person is reported as intestate. The Master of the Supreme Court himself then appoints an executor who may not meet your approval.</p>
			<p>Only spouses and blood relatives may inherit and all of them must first be traced before the administration of the estate can begin. In the meantime, no one receives any money and it can make life difficult for your loved ones. Due to this, the spouse is also only entitled to a portion of the estate and the remainder will be divided among the descendants.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>What makes a will invalid?</h2>
			<p>A last will and testament is a legal document that contains written instructions in which you determine exactly what should happen to your money, property and other assets after your death. No letters, verbal agreement or video and audio testament are valid.</p>
			<p>The person must be mentally competent to fully understand the nature and scope of their will.</p>
			<p>Their full name, identity number, address, date and place signed must appear on the will.</p>
			<p>The will must be signed by the testator(s) and two witnesses on each page and in each other\'s presence. The two witnesses must be older than 16 years of age and not be appointed as heirs or executor of the estate.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Drafting a last will and testament</h2>
			<p>Anyone with the necessary knowledge and expertise can draft a will which will be valid. However, it is not recommended to use a standard will or just rewrite a friend\'s will. A will that is poorly drafted can be invalid, miss opportunities for saving on estate taxes and can be misleading. It can also lead to uncertainties and disputes.</p>
			<p>The more complicated the estate planning, the more important it is to obtain expert assistance for the careful drafting of your last will and testament. The planning and drafting of a will is a specialized matter and the correct terms is of utmost importance.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Amendment of a will</h2>
			<p>A last will and testament can be amended at any time, as long as it is done in a valid way. It is important to regularly review your testament, especially on change of marital status, birth of a child, death of a spouse or child, marriage of a child or change in your assets.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-md-12">
			<h2>Codicil (Additive)</h2>
			<p>Usually a codicil will be used if you want to make a small change or add something to your will. There is no limit to the number of codicils that may be added to a will. However, drafting a new will is recommended if too many additions are attached. Each codicil must be signed by two witnesses and just as in the case of a will, a beneficiary may not sign as a witness. However, it does not have to be signed by the same witnesses that signed the will. Keep the codicil together with your last will and testament for the executor to be aware of it.</p>

			<h2>General</h2>
			<p>A will is a living document - adjust it regularly!!</p>
			<p>To avoid confusion and ensure that the most recent will is followed, it is important to destroy every copy of any previous will.</p>
			<p>If in the case of a joint will, one of the testators dies, it is recommended that the survivor draws up his / her own will as soon as possible. Preserve the joint will, together with the newly drawn up will, as the joint will may contain provisions that may also apply to the surviving person\'s estate.</p>
			<p>Should you prefer to keep the original will itself for safekeeping, a second original may be sent to your executor / solicitor for conservation. Therefor you may sign two original copies of your will.</p>
			<p>You may decide to keep your original will together with all your original documents and give a second original will to your executor/solicitor for conservation. Therefore you must sign two original copies of your will.</p>
