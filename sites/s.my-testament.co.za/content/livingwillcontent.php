			<h2>What is a living will?</h2>
			<p>There is a huge difference between a Testament and a Living Will. A Last will and testament contain your wishes regarding your assets and beneficiaries after your death, where a Living will describe your wishes regarding illness before you die.</p>
			<p>This is obviously a sensitive area for many people and you have to make decisions (after proper consideration) giving directions at your own discretion. Many estate planning specialists include a Living will in their package of estate planning documents.</p>
			<p>A Living will is a statement or indication that the person explicitly indicates that he / she refuses any medical treatment that keeps them artificially alive at a time when he / she is no longer competent or able to express their own wishes and instructions. Setting up a Living will also give you the opportunity to reflect your wishes regarding organ or body donating.</p>

			<h2>How to draft a living will</h2>
			<p>A Living will must be signed while the person is fully conscious and will remain valid even if the person becomes incompetent.  South African law recognizes the validity of a Living will based on a person\'s right to refuse medical treatment, but it is not enforceable. Euthanasia is illegal in South Africa and no doctor or family member may assist a dying person with suicide. Furthermore, doctors have a duty to treat you if there is a prospect of survival.</p>
			<p>It is important that your loved ones are aware of your Living Testament and it is recommended that a copy be placed on file at your general practitioner. The Living will should not be included in or attached to your will. A common mistake that people make is to keep their Living will with their Last will and testament which causes loved ones becoming aware of it when it is too late.</p>

			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			<p>The benefits of a Living Testament are that these commands protect the person\'s human rights as well as the right to refuse medical treatment.  This can be a handy document to sign.  A Living Will can therefore make decisions for your loved ones much easier because they do not have to make these emotional decisions themselves. As a result, many medical expenses can be avoided.</p>
