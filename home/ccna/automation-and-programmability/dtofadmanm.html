					<h3 class="text-success">Automation, Network Management, and Device Management</h3>
					<p>There are many different tasks involved in managing Cisco networks. Some of them are quite repetitive in nature, which makes them good candidates for automation. Not only does this save you time, but it also helps reduce errors that can be introduced during implementation.</p>
					<h4>Automation</h4>
					<p><text class="font-weight-bold font-italic text-primary">Automation</text> is the process of reducing the need for human interaction to perform certain tasks. So, it should follow that network automation is the process of reducing the need for human interaction to configure, manage, deploy, test, and monitor physical and virtual network components. In today's computing environment, thousands of tasks are performed automatically on a regular basis, from downloading and applying software updates to automatic detection of security vulnerabilities. Automation is also a key ingredient in providing and managing cloud-based solutions.</p>
					<ul class="list-group">
						<li class="list-group-item d-flex align-items-left"><text class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><text class="font-weight-bold">Note:</text> This is part of a larger movement generally known as DevOps, which is a set of practices that incorporates software development directly into IT operations.</text></li>
					</ul>
					<h4>How Automation Supports Network Management</h4>
					<p>When you use automation to augment network management, networks can perform the following tasks as a normal part of operation:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Discovering changes in topology</li>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Updating and installing routes</li>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Discovering routes that provide the best forwarding paths</li>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Managing bandwidth</li>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Updating software</li>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Implementing security and compliance</li>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Setting performance benchmarks</li>
						<li class="alert alert-info" role="alert">Performing root cause analysis of network issues</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Not only does automation simplify network management tasks, but it also supports business or organization goals. The business benefits include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Lower costs</li>
						<li class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Increased business continuity</li>
						<li class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Increased productivity of IT staff</li>
						<li class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Increased network control</li>
						<li class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Increased business agility, or the ability of a network to adapt to changes in the environment</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Traditional Campus Device Management Practices</h4>
					<p>When you use traditional campus device management practices, you need to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Manage each device separately.</li>
						<li class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Update each device separately.</li>
						<li class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Document each device separately.</li>
						<li class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Troubleshoot each device separately.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>On a smaller LAN, this is manageable, but as you scale out, say, to a metro-wide or larger network, this approach becomes increasingly unwieldly and prone to errors and oversights.</p>
					<h4>Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center</h4>
					<p>You can automate device management by implementing software such as <text class="font-weight-bold font-italic text-primary">Cisco DNA Center</text>. DNA Center is a <text class="font-italic">centralized management platform</text> that provides a dashboard for every basic management task to simplify running your network. This product provides both <text class="font-italic">controller management</text> and <text class="font-italic">analytics capabilities</text> that enable you to quickly respond to changes and challenges. Cisco DNA Center also provides an open, extensible platform that supports external applications and systems to exchange data and intelligence and build on its native functionality.</p>
